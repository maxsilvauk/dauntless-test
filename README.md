# Dauntless React, NextJS and TypeScript Test

## Overview

Download or clone this repo.

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Notes

- Used the latest app directory now its stable in the latest version of Next 13.
- Now Implemented react-query which consumes Axios
- Had an issue with the /coins/markets endpoint so used /coins but explain within app/currency/[...symbol]/page.tsx why :)

## Thanks for letting be involved in the test for the role!
